# AI-Driven MMORPG: A Virtual World of Generative Agents

Final project for the Building AI course
Author: Yan He

## Summary

This is a large-scale, multiplayer virtual world game where the environment is dynamically constructed by AI, and NPCs are powered by "long-memory" generative agents. Leveraging advancements in AI, the boundary between human players and AI characters becomes indistinguishable, creating a seamless collaborative and social experience.


## Background

Traditional game development relies on the coordination of game designers, artists, and engineers. Designers define mechanics, artists craft environments, and engineers implement the code. To drive plots, games typically use Behavior Trees, but this approach results in linear, pre-enumerated narratives lacking true unpredictability.
This project aims to create an infinite world fueled by player exploration and interaction.
Inspired by Mamoru Hosoda’s 2009 film Summer Wars and the 2023 Stanford paper Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior. 


## How is it used?

The game world generation is AI-driven. Unlike traditional workflows, we utilize Diffusion Models and LLMs to prototype environments, cities, and architectural complexes. 
More importantly, NPCs are no longer bound by hard-coded behavior trees. By assigning NPCs unique personas and backstories, they respond to players in real-time in a manner consistent with their character.
Players can explore freely, triggering quests and plots based solely on their interactions. The most exciting aspect is the "Turing Test" experience—players cannot discern whether a quest-giver is a human or an AI agent.

## Data sources and AI methods
The primary data sources are LLMs and Diffusion models.

- Visuals: Open-source models like FLUX and Qwen2-VL, or closed-source high-fidelity models like Nano Banana Pro, generate the scenes.

- Intelligence: Agents are built using ChatGPT or Gemini. Open-source models like DeepSeek, Qwen, and GLM are ideal for domain-specific fine-tuning.


## Challenges

1. Efficiency & Latency: Real-time interaction requires minimal "thinking-reasoning" lag, which is a hurdle for current heavy LLMs.
2. Long-term Memory: Under the standard Transformer architecture, maintaining consistent long-term memory remains difficult; agents may lose track of context during extended interactions.
3. Persona Accuracy: We need "ordinary" agents, not omniscient assistants. Pruning and specialized prompting are required to simulate a neighbor who might be "ignorant" of complex topics like quantum mechanics.

## What next?

Proof-of-concept can begin with a small-scale implementation based on the Generative Agents architecture. Addressing engineering complexity and inference efficiency is the next priority. The ultimate goal is to create a "second life"—where a restaurant owner in the physical world can find excitement as a legendary rogue in this virtual realm.
